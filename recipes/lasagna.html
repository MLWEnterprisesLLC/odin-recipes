      How to Make Lasagna Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results
      are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and
      step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the
      basics: Lasagna Ingredients The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna
      recipe because it's incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the
      ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true to the
      original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to
      your grocery list: Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian
      sausage and lean ground beef. Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of
      garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor. Tomato products:
      You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two
      cans of tomato paste. Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle
      sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce. Spices and seasonings: This
      lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt,
      Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper. Lasagna noodles: Use
      store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles. Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella,
      and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent. Egg: An egg helps
      bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into
      it. How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step Here's a very brief overview of what
      you can expect when you make homemade lasagna: Make the meat sauce. Cook
      the noodles. Make the ricotta mixture. Layer the lasagna according to the
      recipe instructions. Cover with foil and bake. Let the lasagna rest before
      serving. How to Layer Lasagna The detailed layering instructions can be
      found in the recipe below, but this is the order you'll follow: Meat sauce
      Noodles Ricotta mixture Mozzarella slices Meat sauce Parmesan cheese
      Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Parmesan. How Long to Cook
      Lasagna The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an
      oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25
      minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's
      important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes
      before you cut into it.

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
        heat until well browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season
        with sugar, 2 tablespoons Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring
        occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
        noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
        with cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
        tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
        baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping
        slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of
        the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella,
        and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
        Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
        spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for
        an additional 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
